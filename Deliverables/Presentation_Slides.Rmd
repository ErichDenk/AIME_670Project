# <span style="color:steelblue">**Aim** </span>

 >Build a dashboard that walks policy makers and key stakeholders through the unmet need of these two prevention methods (PrEP and SSP). And, for the states that do allow SSPs, can we predict when they will allow them using new diagnoses data?

# <span style="color:steelblue">**Approach and Design** </span>
- Three main data sources
  1. AidsVu
  2. Center for Disease Control and Prevention State Laws
  3. NASEN SSP locations
  
# <span style="color:steelblue">**Approach and Design (cont.)** </span>
- Our original goal -- countywide incidence - yearly incidence data not available

- Time series at state level doesnâ€™t really show visual change in mapping  - not really impactful. 

- The methods we did use..
  - Web scraping (just NASEN)
  - Data Wrangling
  - Data Visualization
  - Mapping
  - Machine Learning
  - Shiny

# <span style="color:steelblue">**Methods and Tools** </span>

- Dplyr and the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**tidyverse** </span>
- The Shiny App
- Urban Maps
- Caret
- ggiraph
- ggplot2

# <span style="color:steelblue">**Results** </span> 

- The shiny app dashboard. Combines a number of efforts together

  - Our [dashboard](https://annmarie.shinyapps.io/Shiny-Apps/)

  - [(backup link)](https://ivy-deng.shinyapps.io/Shiny-Apps/)
 

Some findings

- PReP usage does not match the need for most states - mapping provides clear visualization of which states in particular
  - Unmet PrEP Demand in states such as Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida. California, Texas, and Florida show a decreasing trend of number of PrEP users overtime. 
  - Southern states in general have more cases of HIV new diagnosis than other regions. However, there are fewer users of PrEP in those states compared to other regions. 
- The states with highest unmet need for SSP do not have legislation in place to legalize SSPs
  - Especially: TX, FL, GA, PA
  - West and Northeast regions tend to be more likely to have legislation and lower unmet need, South least likely. 




# <span style="color:steelblue">**Results** </span>
The second (and less successful) effort: Our supervised machine learning results

- Random regression trees
- knn
- random forests

Extremely good at predicting which state-years would *not* allow Syringe Exchange Programs, but not very good at predicting those that do.

Random Forest with extratrees and mtry = 34 was the best model. In that model, here is the relative importance

# <span style="color:steelblue">**Lessons Learned** </span>

- Be flexible! Try to let your preconcieved notions go

- Opportunity to learn about a new topic

- [urbnmapr] package! Perfect for mapping geospatial data. 

- Shiny app. Efficient way to display data in various forms and let audience interact with data. 


# <span style="color:steelblue">**Conclusions** </span>

- States with a high HIV prevalence/incidence should invest more resources in supporting and promoting HIV prevention programs (PrEP and SSPs)

# <span style="color:steelblue">**Thanks!** </span>

- Any questions?
